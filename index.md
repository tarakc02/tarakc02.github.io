Hi I'm Tarak. I work as a data analyst in Prospect Development at UC Berkeley, but this site is just for fiddling around. The [projects](/projects) page has some R packages I've developed. I can't commit to a regular blog, but sometimes I like to write up little [mathgames](/mathgames).

Where else I can be found:

- github: [tarakc02](https://github.com/tarakc02/)
- twitter: [tarakc02](https://twitter.com/tarakc02)
- pinboard: [tarakc02](https://pinboard.in/u:tarakc02)
- email: <span class = "typewriter">tarak_shah at berkeley.edu</span>
