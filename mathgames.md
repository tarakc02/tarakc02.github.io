<h1>JUST WHATEVER</h1>
- [GNU tools for data analysts](https://github.com/tarakc02/gnutools): Introducing some of the GNU utilities in a Unix terminal by way of analogies to the verbs of SQL, dplyr, etc.
- [Branch and bound using lazily evaluated lists](/branch-and-bound): Implementing a branch-and-bound solver for the knapsack problem using lazily evaluated lists, and comparing performance of different approximation algorithms. 
- [Population inferences from incomplete and biased data](/mse): Using multiple systems estimation techniques to make defensible inferences about a population when our data is incomplete and/or biased.
- [Searching for Ramanujan's taxicab numbers](/taxicab): Trying to find numbers that can be expressed as the sum of two positive cubes in two different ways.
- [Solving the 8-puzzle with lazy evaluation](/puzzle8): Solving a popular tile-based game using lazily evaluated lists.
- [Building a stack data structure with functions](/fun-stack): Understanding functions, closures, and environments by implementing a stack.
- [Grouping Stack Overflow question tags](/stacklite): Thinking of database tables as sparse matrices allows us to do big matrix multiplications without access to much memory. One use case is to group large numbers of user-generated tags. 
- [Creating dot-density plots](/dot-density): Using census demographic data to create dot-density plots of educational attainment in Alameda County.
- [Generating fake names that sound real(ish)](https://rpubs.com/tarakc02/name-project-1): Building models to generate first names that don't appear in the training data, but sound real. 
- [Playing the median game](/mediangame): Experimenting with strategies to play the median game.
- [Learning from ants](https://uponinspection.wordpress.com/2013/01/26/learning-from-ants/): Modeling a colony of ants in order to attack the Travelling Salesperson Problem.
- [Estimating the number of jelly beans in the jar](https://uponinspection.wordpress.com/2013/01/16/estimating-the-number-of-jelly-beans-in-the-jar/): Using the mark-and-recapture method to estimate the number of jelly beans in a jar.
